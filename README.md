# 📱 Naranja Segura – Civic Security App Prototype

**This repository documents the work developed by our team for the Civic Technology Challenge organized by ICTI, the City of Morelia, SEMMUJERIS, TecNM Campus Morelia, and the Civic Technologies Lab A.C.**

## 🌟 Objective

**Naranja Segura** is a mobile app prototype designed to **provide immediate support to women in dangerous or emergency situations**, offering features such as:

- An interactive map showing nearby safe spaces ("Puntos Naranja").
- An emergency button that shares the user's real-time location with trusted contacts.
- Visualization of reported dangerous routes.
- Anonymous reporting and access to safety protocols.

## 🧠 Key Design Aspects

### 🛠️ Architecture: MVC Pattern

The solution follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern to ensure a clear separation between:

- **Model:** handles data like users, location, safe spots, emergency contacts.
- **View:** screens like maps, emergency mode, login, reports, etc.
- **Controller:** manages navigation logic, validations, and user flow.

### 👤 Main Use Cases

- Register with email verification.
- Activate emergency mode from screen or notification.
- View community-reported dangerous routes.
- Report incidents (even offline).
- Locate and navigate to the nearest "Punto Naranja".

### 🔐 Legal and Cybersecurity Considerations

Includes measures aligned with:

- Mexico’s Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LFPDPPP).
- Olimpia Law (against digital violence).
- Basic cybersecurity practices: data encryption, anonymous reporting, secure login.

## 🎨 Visual Design and User Experience

- Empathetic, clear, and accessible interface.
- Official color palette and fonts from the Government of Michoacán.
- Fast and intuitive navigation for emergency situations.
- Compatible with Android 8.0+ (iOS support planned).
